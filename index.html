Pasta recipe
<ol>
<li>Boil water in a large pot</li>
<li>To make sure pasta doesn’t stick together, use at least 4 quarts of water for every pound of noodles.</li>
<li>Salt the water with at least a tablespoon—more is fine</li>
<li>The salty water adds flavor to the pasta.</li>
<li>Add pasta</li>
<li>Pour pasta into boiling water. Don’t break the pasta; it will soften up within 30 seconds and fit into the pot.</li>
<li>Stir the pasta</li>
<li>As the pasta starts to cook, stir it well with the tongs so the noodles don’t stick to each other (or the pot).</li>
<li>Test the pasta by tasting it</li>
<li>Follow the cooking time on the package, but always taste pasta before draining to make sure the texture is right. Pasta cooked properly should be al dente—a little 

chewy.</li>
<li>Drain the pasta</li>
<li>Drain cooked pasta well in a colander. If serving hot, add sauce right away; if you’re making a pasta salad, run noodles under cold water to stop the cooking.</li>
</ol>
